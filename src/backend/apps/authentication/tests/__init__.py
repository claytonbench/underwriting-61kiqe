"""
Authentication App Testing Package

This package contains tests for the authentication application. The tests are organized to
mirror the structure of the application code to maintain clear correlation between tests
and implementation.

Common test utilities and fixtures for authentication testing are provided here to facilitate
consistent and DRY test implementations across the authentication test suite.
"""

# Import any necessary modules that will be common across authentication tests
# For example, pytest fixtures, helper functions, etc.

# Define common test fixtures for authentication testing if needed
# These fixtures would be importable by all test modules in this package

# No specific code is included here yet as the authentication app test structure
# will be further defined as the application develops. This file primarily serves
# to make the tests directory a proper Python package.

/**
 * Barrel file for the FileUpload component.
 * 
 * This file exports the FileUpload component from the FileUpload directory,
 * allowing for cleaner imports throughout the application.
 * Instead of importing from the specific file path:
 * import FileUpload from 'components/common/FileUpload/FileUpload';
 * 
 * Components can use the simplified import:
 * import FileUpload from 'components/common/FileUpload';

# Backup and Recovery Procedures

## Introduction

This document provides comprehensive guidance for backup and recovery procedures for the loan management system. It covers database backups, document storage backups, configuration backups, and disaster recovery procedures. These procedures are essential for ensuring data integrity, business continuity, and compliance with regulatory requirements for financial data.

## Backup Strategy Overview

The loan management system implements a multi-layered backup strategy to protect different types of data with appropriate methods, frequencies, and retention policies.

### Backup Types

The system uses several types of backups for different components:

1. **Database Backups**:
   - Full backups: Complete database dumps
   - Incremental backups: Changes since the last full backup
   - Transaction log backups: Continuous transaction logging for point-in-time recovery

2. **Document Storage Backups**:
   - S3 versioning: Maintains versions of all documents
   - Cross-region replication: Replicates documents to a secondary region
   - Lifecycle policies: Manages document versions and transitions to cheaper storage

3. **Configuration Backups**:
   - Infrastructure as Code (Terraform state)
   - Application configuration
   - Security settings
   - Integration configurations

4. **Application State Backups**:
   - Stateless design minimizes need for application state backups
   - Critical state stored in database or S3

### Backup Schedule

Backup frequency varies by environment and data criticality:

| Data Type | Development | Staging | Production |
|-----------|-------------|---------|------------|
| Database - Full | Weekly | Daily | Daily |
| Database - Incremental | Daily | 6 hours | Hourly |
| Database - Transaction Logs | N/A | 30 minutes | 15 minutes |
| Document Storage | Versioning only | Daily replication | Continuous replication |
| Configuration | On change | On change | On change |

Additional pre-deployment backups are taken before any significant changes to production systems.

### Retention Policies

Backup retention follows these policies:

1. **Database Backups**:
   - Daily backups: 30 days
   - Weekly backups: 3 months
   - Monthly backups: 1 year
   - Yearly backups: 7 years (for compliance)

2. **Document Storage**:
   - Current versions: Indefinite
   - Previous versions: 90 days in standard storage
   - Archived versions: 7 years in glacier storage

3. **Configuration Backups**:
   - Last 10 versions retained
   - Major version changes retained for 1 year

4. **Pre-deployment Backups**:
   - Retained until successful verification of deployment plus 7 days

### Backup Storage

Backups are stored securely with appropriate controls:

1. **Primary Storage**:
   - Database backups: Encrypted S3 buckets
   - Document storage: S3 with versioning and encryption
   - Configuration: Version-controlled repositories and encrypted S3

2. **Secondary Storage**:
   - Cross-region replication for disaster recovery
   - Separate AWS account for critical backups
   - Offline storage for yearly compliance backups

3. **Security Controls**:
   - Encryption at rest using AWS KMS
   - Strict access controls via IAM policies
   - Immutable backups for compliance
   - Audit logging of all backup access

## Database Backup Procedures

Database backups are critical for protecting the core data of the loan management system.

### Automated Backup Configuration

The RDS instances are configured with automated backups:

1. **AWS RDS Automated Backups**:
   - Enabled with appropriate retention period
   - Backup window configured during off-peak hours
   - Point-in-time recovery enabled
   - Automated snapshots stored in S3

2. **Configuration Parameters**:
   ```terraform
   resource "aws_db_instance" "main" {
     # Other configuration...
     backup_retention_period = 30  # Days to retain automated backups
     backup_window           = "02:00-04:00"  # UTC time
     copy_tags_to_snapshot   = true
     deletion_protection     = true
     # Multi-AZ configuration for high availability
     multi_az                = true
   }
   ```

3. **Monitoring**:
   - CloudWatch alarms for backup failures
   - Daily verification of backup completion
   - Size monitoring and trending

### Manual Backup Procedures

Manual backups are performed in addition to automated backups:

1. **Pre-Deployment Backups**:
   - Full database backup before any production deployment
   - Verification of backup integrity
   - Documentation of backup ID and timestamp

2. **Manual Backup Command**:
   ```bash
   # Using the backup script
   ./infrastructure/scripts/backup-db.sh \
     -t full \
     -d loan_management \
     -h db.production.loanmanagementsystem.com \
     -u dbadmin \
     -b loan-management-backups-production \
     -p production/manual \
     -e production
   ```

3. **Backup Verification**:
   - Automated integrity check after backup
   - Sample restoration test monthly
   - Documentation of verification results

### Transaction Log Backups

Transaction logs enable point-in-time recovery:

1. **Configuration**:
   - PostgreSQL WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) enabled
   - Archive mode enabled for continuous archiving
   - WAL segments shipped to S3 bucket

2. **Backup Command**:
   ```bash
   # Using the backup script for transaction logs
   ./infrastructure/scripts/backup-db.sh \
     -t transaction_log \
     -d loan_management \
     -h db.production.loanmanagementsystem.com \
     -u dbadmin \
     -b loan-management-backups-production \
     -p production/wal_logs \
     -e production
   ```

3. **Recovery Point Objective**:
   - Development: 24 hours
   - Staging: 6 hours
   - Production: 15 minutes

### Backup Encryption

All database backups are encrypted:

1. **Encryption Methods**:
   - RDS encryption using AWS KMS
   - Backup encryption during transfer
   - S3 server-side encryption for stored backups

2. **Key Management**:
   - KMS keys rotated annually
   - Separate keys for different environments
   - Key access strictly controlled

3. **Verification**:
   - Regular audit of encryption settings
   - Validation of encrypted backup restoration

## Document Storage Backup Procedures

Document storage backups protect loan agreements, applications, and other critical documents.

### S3 Versioning Configuration

S3 versioning provides built-in backup for documents:

1. **Versioning Configuration**:
   ```terraform
   resource "aws_s3_bucket_versioning" "document_bucket_versioning" {
     bucket = aws_s3_bucket.document_bucket.id
     versioning_configuration {
       status = "Enabled"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Version Management**:
   - All object changes create new versions
   - Previous versions retained according to lifecycle policy
   - Accidental deletions can be recovered

3. **Access Controls**:
   - Version-specific permissions
   - Immutable versions for compliance
   - Audit logging of version access

### Cross-Region Replication

Cross-region replication provides geographic redundancy:

1. **Replication Configuration**:
   ```terraform
   resource "aws_s3_bucket_replication_configuration" "document_bucket_replication" {
     bucket = aws_s3_bucket.document_bucket.id
     role   = aws_iam_role.replication_role.arn
     
     rule {
       id       = "document-replication"
       status   = "Enabled"
       priority = 0
       
       destination {
         bucket = aws_s3_bucket.document_bucket_replica.arn
         encryption_configuration {
           replica_kms_key_id = var.replica_kms_key_id
         }
       }
       
       source_selection_criteria {
         sse_kms_encrypted_objects {
           status = "Enabled"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

     rule {
       id     = "document-lifecycle"
       status = "Enabled"
       
       noncurrent_version_transition {
         noncurrent_days = 30  # Move to STANDARD_IA after 30 days
         storage_class  = "STANDARD_IA"
       }
       
       noncurrent_version_transition {
         noncurrent_days = 90  # Move to GLACIER after 90 days
         storage_class  = "GLACIER"
       }
       
       noncurrent_version_expiration {
         noncurrent_days = 2555  # Expire after 7 years (compliance requirement)
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Storage Classes**:
   - Current versions in STANDARD
   - 30-day-old versions in STANDARD_IA
   - 90-day-old versions in GLACIER
   - Expiration after 7 years

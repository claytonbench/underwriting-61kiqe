The system is deployed across three primary environments:

1. **Development Environment**
   - Purpose: Development and initial testing
   - Access: Development team
   - Update Frequency: Continuous (multiple times per day)
   - Stability Expectation: Experimental, may have issues
   - URL: https://dev.loanmanagementsystem.com

2. **Staging Environment**
   - Purpose: Pre-production testing and validation
   - Access: Development team, QA team, selected stakeholders
   - Update Frequency: Daily or per-feature
   - Stability Expectation: Stable, close to production
   - URL: https://staging.loanmanagementsystem.com

3. **Production Environment**
   - Purpose: Live system used by real users
   - Access: All users, operations team
   - Update Frequency: Scheduled releases (typically weekly)
   - Stability Expectation: Highly stable
   - URL: https://app.loanmanagementsystem.com

### Environment Configuration
Each environment has specific configurations managed through environment variables and settings:

1. **Configuration Sources**:
   - Environment variables in deployment pipelines
   - AWS Parameter Store for sensitive values
   - Environment-specific Terraform variable files
   - Environment-specific application settings

2. **Key Configuration Differences**:

| Configuration | Development | Staging | Production |
|--------------|-------------|---------|------------|
| Database | Smaller instance (t3.medium) | Mid-size instance (t3.large) | Production instance (m5.xlarge) |
| Scaling | Fixed instance count (2) | Auto-scaling (2-4) | Auto-scaling (4-12) |
| Cache | Single node | 2-node cluster | 3-node cluster with replication |
| Logging | Verbose | Standard | Standard with extended retention |
| Features | All features, including experimental | All approved features | Stable features only |

3. **Environment Isolation**:
   - Separate AWS accounts for each environment
   - Strict network boundaries between environments
   - No shared resources between environments
   - Data isolation with no production data in non-production environments

### Production Deployment
Production deployments follow a strict process with additional safeguards:

1. **Trigger Methods**:
   - Manual approval after successful staging deployment
   - Release tag creation (vX.Y.Z)

2. **Deployment Steps**:
   - Create pre-deployment database backup
   - Code checkout from release tag
   - Build backend and frontend containers
   - Run comprehensive test suite
   - Push containers to production ECR repository
   - Update ECS task definitions
   - Deploy to ECS cluster with blue/green deployment

### Database Migrations
Database migrations require special handling during deployment:

1. **Migration Types**:
   - Schema migrations (structure changes)
   - Data migrations (content changes)
   - Index modifications

2. **Migration Process**:
   - Pre-deployment backup
   - Apply migrations using Django migration framework
   - Verify migration success
   - Run post-migration validation

3. **Backward Compatibility**:
   - Migrations must be backward compatible with previous application version
   - Two-phase migrations for breaking changes:
     - Phase 1: Add new structure without removing old
     - Phase 2: Remove old structure after code is updated

4. **Rollback Plan**:
   - Automated rollback for failed migrations
   - Manual rollback procedures for complex migrations
   - Database restore from backup if needed

### Blue/Green Deployment
Production and staging use blue/green deployment for zero-downtime updates:

1. **Implementation**:
   - AWS CodeDeploy for ECS deployments
   - Two target groups (blue and green)
   - Application Load Balancer for traffic management

2. **Deployment Flow**:
   - Deploy new version alongside existing version
   - Run health checks on new version
   - Shift small percentage of traffic (10%) to new version
   - Monitor for errors and performance issues
   - Gradually increase traffic to new version
   - Complete cutover when verified
   - Terminate old version after grace period

3. **Canary Testing**:
   - Initial 10% traffic serves as canary test
   - Automatic rollback if error rates exceed thresholds
   - Manual promotion to 50% and 100% after verification

4. **Rollback Process**:
   - Shift traffic back to original version
   - Terminate new version
   - Investigate issues before retry

## Deployment Monitoring and Verification

   - Fix forward vs. rollback analysis
   - Time to fix vs. time to roll back
   - Data integrity concerns

3. **Approval Process**:
   - Development: Team lead approval
   - Staging: Engineering manager approval
   - Production: CTO or designated deputy approval

### Application Rollback Process
Process for rolling back application code:

1. **Blue/Green Rollback (Production/Staging)**:
   - Shift traffic back to previous version (blue)
   - Verify functionality on previous version
   - Terminate new version (green)
   - Update deployment status in monitoring systems
   ```bash
   # Using AWS CLI
   aws deploy stop-deployment \
     --deployment-id <deployment-id> \
     --auto-rollback-enabled
   ```

2. **Rolling Update Rollback (Development)**:
   - Deploy previous version using normal deployment process
   - Specify previous container image tag
   ```bash
   # Using AWS CLI
   aws ecs update-service \
     --cluster loan-management-development \
     --service loan-management-backend-development \
     --task-definition loan-management-backend-development:previous
   ```

3. **Post-Rollback Actions**:
   - Notify stakeholders of rollback
   - Update monitoring thresholds if needed
   - Document rollback in incident log
   - Schedule post-mortem meeting

### Database Rollback Process
Process for rolling back database changes:

1. **Migration Rollback**:
   - For reversible migrations, use Django's migration rollback
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate app_name migration_name
   ```
   - Verify database state after rollback
   - Update application to be compatible with rolled-back schema

2. **Data Restoration**:
   - For data corruption or irreversible migrations
   - Restore from pre-deployment backup
   - Apply any transactions that occurred after backup
   - Verify data integrity after restoration

3. **Point-in-Time Recovery**:
   - For RDS databases, use point-in-time recovery
   - Select timestamp before deployment
   - Create new instance from recovery point
   - Verify data and switch connection string

4. **Database Backup Procedures**:
   - Production database backups occur daily (automated)
   - Pre-deployment backups are taken manually
   - Backups are stored in encrypted S3 buckets
   - Backup retention period is 30 days
   - Full restoration process is tested monthly

### Infrastructure Rollback Process
Process for rolling back infrastructure changes:

1. **Terraform Rollback**:
   - Revert to previous Terraform state version
   ```bash
   # List state versions
   aws s3api list-object-versions \
     --bucket loan-management-terraform-state \
     --key terraform.tfstate
   
   # Restore specific version
   aws s3api copy-object \
     --bucket loan-management-terraform-state \
     --copy-source loan-management-terraform-state/terraform.tfstate?versionId=<version-id> \
     --key terraform.tfstate
   ```
   - Apply previous infrastructure configuration
   - Verify infrastructure state after rollback

2. **Manual Infrastructure Adjustments**:
   - For targeted rollbacks of specific components
   - Revert security group changes
   - Restore previous IAM policies
   - Revert load balancer configuration

3. **Verification**:
   - Verify all services are running correctly
   - Check connectivity between components
   - Validate security configurations
   - Test application functionality

## Deployment Best Practices
Best practices for successful deployments of the loan management system.

### Deployment Planning
Proper planning is essential for successful deployments:

1. **Release Planning**:
   - Group related changes into cohesive releases
   - Document all changes in release notes
   - Identify dependencies between changes
   - Assess risk level of each change

2. **Scheduling**:
   - Schedule production deployments during off-peak hours
   - Avoid deployments before weekends or holidays
   - Allow sufficient time for testing and verification
   - Consider business calendar and avoid critical business periods

3. **Communication**:
   - Notify stakeholders of deployment schedule
   - Communicate expected downtime or service impact
   - Provide clear rollback and escalation paths
   - Send confirmation when deployment is complete

### Deployment Patterns
Effective deployment patterns to minimize risk:

1. **Incremental Changes**:
   - Prefer smaller, incremental deployments
   - Limit scope of each deployment
   - Easier to troubleshoot if issues occur
   - Faster rollback if needed

2. **Feature Flags**:
   - Use feature flags for risky changes
   - Deploy code in disabled state
   - Enable features gradually after deployment
   - Allows quick disabling without rollback

3. **Dark Launches**:
   - Deploy new functionality without exposing to users
   - Test in production environment with synthetic traffic
   - Gradually expose to internal users, then external
   - Monitor performance and errors before full launch

### Database Changes
Special considerations for database changes:

1. **Backward Compatibility**:
   - Ensure database changes work with both old and new code
   - Use two-phase migrations for breaking changes
   - Add new structures before removing old ones
   - Maintain data integrity during transitions

2. **Performance Impact**:
   - Test migrations on representative data volume
   - Schedule long-running migrations during off-peak hours
   - Consider table locking implications
   - Use background migrations for large tables

3. **Data Integrity**:
   - Always backup before migrations
   - Verify data before and after migration
   - Include validation steps in migration scripts
   - Have rollback plan for each migration

### Monitoring and Observability
Enhanced monitoring during and after deployments:

1. **Deployment Markers**:
   - Add deployment annotations to monitoring dashboards
   - Tag metrics with deployment IDs
   - Correlate errors with recent deployments
   - Compare performance before and after deployment

2. **Enhanced Alerting**:
   - Lower thresholds immediately after deployment
   - Increase alert sensitivity for critical metrics
   - Route alerts to deployment team
   - Gradually return to normal thresholds

3. **Deployment Dashboard**:
   - Create dedicated dashboard for deployment monitoring
   - Include key performance and error metrics
   - Show before/after comparisons
   - Highlight critical user journeys

### Post-Deployment Activities
Important activities after deployment completion:

1. **Verification**:
   - Execute post-deployment test plan
   - Verify all components are functioning
   - Check integration points
   - Monitor error rates and performance

2. **Documentation**:
   - Update system documentation
   - Record deployment details and outcomes
   - Document any issues and resolutions
   - Update runbooks if procedures changed

3. **Knowledge Sharing**:
   - Conduct deployment retrospective
   - Share lessons learned
   - Update deployment process as needed
   - Train team on new features or changes

   - Higher resource utilization
   - Database query performance
   - Memory leaks

2. **Diagnostic Steps**:
   - Compare metrics before and after deployment
   - Identify specific slow components
   - Check database query plans
   - Review application logs for errors

3. **Resolution Strategies**:
   - Optimize problematic queries
   - Scale resources if needed
   - Fix application code issues
   - Implement caching where appropriate
   - Consider rollback if severe impact

## Backup and Disaster Recovery
Essential backup and recovery procedures for deployment safety.

### Database Backup Procedures
Regular and pre-deployment database backups are critical for system safety:

1. **Backup Types**:
   - Automated daily backups (full backup)
   - Hourly incremental backups
   - Pre-deployment manual backups
   - Transaction log backups (continuous)

2. **Backup Storage**:
   - Primary backups in S3 with encryption
   - Cross-region replication for disaster recovery
   - Backup metadata stored in dedicated database
   - Retention policies enforced automatically

3. **Verification Procedures**:
   - Automated backup integrity checks
   - Monthly test restores to verify recoverability
   - Documentation of verified backups
   - Monitoring of backup success/failure

### Deployment-Specific Backups
Special backup procedures during deployment:

1. **Pre-Deployment Backups**:
   - Full database backup before major deployments
   - Configuration backup before infrastructure changes
   - Tagged with deployment ID for easy identification
   - Verified before proceeding with deployment

2. **Backup Command Examples**:
   ```bash
   # Create pre-deployment database backup
   aws rds create-db-snapshot \
     --db-instance-identifier loan-management-production \
     --db-snapshot-identifier pre-deploy-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M)
   
   # Verify backup was created
   aws rds describe-db-snapshots \
     --db-snapshot-identifier pre-deploy-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M)
   ```

3. **Backup Documentation**:
   - Record backup ID in deployment log
   - Document restoration procedure
   - Include backup verification results
   - Identify backup retention period

### Emergency Restoration Procedures
Procedures for emergency database restoration:

1. **Full Database Restoration**:
   ```bash
   # Restore from snapshot
   aws rds restore-db-instance-from-db-snapshot \
     --db-instance-identifier loan-management-production-restored \
     --db-snapshot-identifier pre-deploy-20230501120000
   
   # Wait for the restore to complete
   aws rds wait db-instance-available \
     --db-instance-identifier loan-management-production-restored
   ```

2. **Point-in-Time Recovery**:
   ```bash
   # Restore to a specific point in time
   aws rds restore-db-instance-to-point-in-time \
     --source-db-instance-identifier loan-management-production \
     --target-db-instance-identifier loan-management-production-restored \
     --restore-time 2023-05-01T12:00:00Z
   ```

3. **Application Reconfiguration**:
   - Update connection strings to point to restored database
   - Verify application connectivity
   - Validate data integrity
   - Perform application-specific reconciliation if needed

### Configuration Backups
Backing up critical configuration before deployment:

1. **Infrastructure Configuration**:
   - Terraform state backup
   - CloudFormation template versioning
   - IAM policy backups
   - Security group configuration exports

2. **Application Configuration**:
   - Environment variable snapshots
   - Configuration file backups
   - Feature flag state exports
   - Integration settings documentation

3. **Restoration Testing**:
   - Periodic restoration drills
   - Validated restoration procedures
   - Cross-team restoration exercises
   - Timing metrics for recovery objectives

## Introduction

This guide provides system administrators with detailed instructions on how to use the administrative features of the loan management system. As a system administrator, you have access to all aspects of the system including user management, school management, reporting, system configuration, and more.

The loan management system is designed to streamline the educational loan process from application to funding. As an administrator, you play a crucial role in maintaining the system, managing users, configuring schools and programs, and ensuring everything runs smoothly.

## Getting Started

To access the administrative features, you must first log in with your administrator credentials. After logging in, you will be directed to the Admin Dashboard which provides an overview of system metrics and quick access to key administrative functions.

1. Open your web browser and navigate to the loan management system URL
2. Enter your administrator username and password
3. If multi-factor authentication is enabled, complete the verification process
4. You will be redirected to the Admin Dashboard

> **Note:** If this is your first time logging in with a new account, you may be prompted to change your password and set up multi-factor authentication.

## Admin Dashboard

The Admin Dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of the loan management system, including application statistics, underwriting metrics, funding status, and system health. From this dashboard, you can quickly access all administrative functions and monitor the overall health of the system.

### Dashboard Components

The dashboard includes several key components:

- **Application Statistics:** Shows counts of applications by status
  - New applications
  - In review
  - Approved
  - Declined
  - Funded

- **Underwriting Metrics:** Displays approval rates and decision times
  - Approval percentage
  - Average decision time
  - Applications in queue

- **Funding Status:** Provides information on pending and completed funding
  - Ready for funding
  - Funded this month
  - Average funding time

- **System Health:** Monitors key system performance indicators
  - API response times
  - Error rates
  - Resource utilization

- **Quick Access:** Links to frequently used administrative functions
  - User management
  - School management
  - Reports
  - System settings

### Navigating from the Dashboard

Use the navigation menu on the left side of the screen to access different administrative functions. The dashboard also includes quick access cards for commonly used features.

The main navigation menu includes:
- Dashboard
- Schools
- Users
- Applications
- Underwriting
- Documents
- Funding
- Reports
- System
- Settings

Each menu item may have sub-items that appear when you click on the main item.

## User Management

The User Management section allows you to create, edit, and manage user accounts within the system. You can manage different types of users including borrowers, co-borrowers, school administrators, underwriters, QC personnel, and system administrators.

To access User Management, click on "Users" in the main navigation menu.

### Viewing Users

The User List page displays all users in the system. You can filter the list by user type, status, and other criteria. The list shows key information about each user including name, email, role, and status.

The User List includes the following columns:
- ID: Unique identifier for the user
- Name: User's full name
- Email: User's email address
- Role: User's role in the system
- Status: Active or Inactive
- Actions: Buttons for Edit, Reset Password, etc.

You can customize the columns displayed in the list by clicking the "Columns" button above the list.

### Creating a New User

To create a new user:

1. Click the 'Add User' button on the User List page
2. Fill in the required user information including:
   - First Name
   - Last Name
   - Email Address
   - Phone Number
3. Select the appropriate user type/role:
   - Borrower
   - Co-Borrower
   - School Administrator
   - Underwriter
   - Quality Control
   - System Administrator
4. Assign permissions based on the user's role
5. If creating a School Administrator, select the associated school
6. Set the user's status (Active/Inactive)
7. Click 'Save' to create the user

The system will automatically send an email to the new user with instructions for setting up their password.

> **Important:** For security reasons, you should never set a password for a user. Always use the password reset functionality to allow users to create their own secure passwords.

### Editing a User

To edit an existing user:

1. Find the user in the User List
2. Click the 'Edit' button for that user
3. Update the user's information as needed:
   - Personal information (name, contact details)
   - Role and permissions
   - Status
   - Associated school (for school administrators)
4. Click 'Save Changes' to apply the updates

Any changes to a user's role or permissions will take effect immediately upon saving.

### Managing User Permissions

User permissions are based on roles. When editing a user, you can assign specific permissions within their role category. This allows for fine-grained control over what actions each user can perform in the system.

Each role has a default set of permissions, but you can customize these for individual users:

**Borrower/Co-Borrower Permissions:**
- View own applications
- Submit applications
- Upload documents
- Sign documents

**School Administrator Permissions:**
- View school applications
- Create applications
- Manage programs
- Sign documents
- View reports
- Manage school users

**Underwriter Permissions:**
- View applications
- Make underwriting decisions
- Set stipulations
- View reports

**Quality Control Permissions:**
- Review documents
- Verify stipulations
- Approve for funding
- View reports

**System Administrator Permissions:**
- All system permissions

To modify permissions:
1. Edit the user
2. In the Permissions section, check or uncheck specific permissions
3. Save the changes

### Resetting User Passwords

To reset a user's password:

1. Find the user in the User List
2. Click the 'Reset Password' button for that user
3. Confirm the action in the dialog that appears

The system will send an email to the user with instructions for creating a new password. The email will contain a secure link that expires after 24 hours.

> **Note:** For security reasons, administrators cannot set or view user passwords. The reset process always requires the user to create their own password.

### Activating/Deactivating Users

To change a user's active status:

1. Find the user in the User List
2. Click the 'Activate' or 'Deactivate' button for that user
3. Confirm the action in the dialog that appears

Deactivated users cannot log into the system but their accounts and associated data are preserved. This is preferable to deleting users, as it maintains the integrity of historical data and audit trails.

To reactivate a deactivated user, follow the same process and click the 'Activate' button.

## School Management

The School Management section allows you to create and manage schools and their associated educational programs. This includes setting up school profiles, configuring programs, and managing school administrators.

To access School Management, click on "Schools" in the main navigation menu.

   - Active: Fully operational in the system
   - Inactive: Not currently accepting applications
   - Pending: In setup phase
4. Add school administrators if needed (can also be done later)
5. Click 'Save' to create the school

After creating a school, you'll be prompted to add programs or return to the school list.

### Editing a School

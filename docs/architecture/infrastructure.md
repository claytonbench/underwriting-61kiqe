# Infrastructure Architecture

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the infrastructure architecture for the loan management system. The infrastructure is designed to be secure, scalable, and highly available to support the critical financial operations of the application.

## Deployment Environment

The loan management system is deployed on AWS cloud infrastructure using a multi-environment approach to support the development lifecycle.

### Environment Strategy

The system uses three distinct environments:

- **Development**: For active development and testing
- **Staging**: For pre-production validation and user acceptance testing
- **Production**: For live operations

Each environment is isolated with its own resources to prevent cross-environment impacts.

### Infrastructure as Code

All infrastructure is provisioned and managed using Terraform, with the following structure:

- **Modules**: Reusable components for VPC, ECS, RDS, S3, ElastiCache, and security
- **Environments**: Environment-specific configurations in separate directories
- **State Management**: Remote state stored in S3 with DynamoDB locking
- **Variables**: Environment-specific variables defined in terraform.tfvars files

### Resource Requirements

| Resource Type | Development | Staging | Production |
|---------------|------------|---------|------------|
| Compute | 2 vCPU, 4 instances | 4 vCPU, 6 instances | 8 vCPU, 12+ instances (auto-scaling) |
| Memory | 8GB per instance | 16GB per instance | 32GB per instance |
| Storage | 100GB SSD | 500GB SSD | 1TB SSD + S3 for documents |
| Network | 1Gbps | 1Gbps | 10Gbps with WAF |

## Cloud Services

The loan management system leverages several AWS services to provide a robust, secure, and scalable infrastructure.

### Core Services

| Service | Purpose | Configuration |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| Amazon ECS | Container orchestration | Fargate for serverless container management |
| Amazon RDS | Database service | PostgreSQL 15+, Multi-AZ deployment |
| Amazon S3 | Document storage | Versioning enabled, server-side encryption |
| Amazon ElastiCache | Caching layer | Redis 7.0+, cluster mode enabled |

## CI/CD Pipeline

The continuous integration and deployment pipeline automates the build, test, and deployment processes for the application.

### Pipeline Architecture

The CI/CD pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions with the following stages:

1. **Code Checkout**: Retrieve source code from repository
2. **Build**: Compile code and build container images
3. **Test**: Run unit tests, integration tests, and security scans
4. **Publish**: Push container images to Amazon ECR
5. **Deploy**: Update ECS services with new container images
6. **Verify**: Run post-deployment tests to verify functionality

### Environment Promotion

Code promotion across environments follows this workflow:

1. **Development**: Automatic deployment on merge to develop branch
2. **Staging**: Promotion requires successful tests and code review
3. **Production**: Manual approval required after staging validation

Each promotion includes appropriate testing and validation steps.

### Deployment Strategy

| Environment | Strategy | Validation | Rollback Procedure |

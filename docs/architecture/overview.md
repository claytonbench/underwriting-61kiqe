# Loan Management System Architecture Overview

## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive architectural overview of the loan management system designed for educational financing. The system enables schools, students (borrowers), co-borrowers, and internal staff to manage the entire loan application lifecycle from submission through underwriting, approval, document signing, and funding.

The architecture follows modern design principles including separation of concerns, domain-driven design, and service-oriented architecture to create a scalable, maintainable, and secure platform for handling sensitive financial transactions and personal data.

This overview serves as an entry point to more detailed architecture documentation, providing a high-level understanding of the system's components, interactions, and design principles.

## Architectural Principles

The loan management system architecture is guided by the following key principles:

### Separation of Concerns

The system is designed with clear boundaries between presentation, business logic, and data access layers. This separation enables independent development, testing, and maintenance of each layer, reducing complexity and improving code quality.

### Domain-Driven Design

Core business entities (users, schools, loan applications, etc.) are modeled as distinct domains with their own models, services, and APIs. This approach ensures that related functionality is grouped together and that each domain has clear boundaries and responsibilities.

### Service-Oriented Architecture

Business capabilities are exposed as services with well-defined interfaces. Each service encapsulates specific business logic and provides a clean API for other components to interact with. This promotes reusability, testability, and maintainability.

### Event-Driven Communication

Key system events trigger notifications and workflow transitions, enabling loose coupling between components and asynchronous processing of time-consuming operations.

### Security by Design

Authentication, authorization, and data protection are built into the architecture from the ground up, ensuring that sensitive financial and personal information is properly secured at all levels of the system.

### Scalability and Performance

The architecture is designed to scale horizontally to handle increasing load, with performance considerations for critical operations like document generation and application processing.

### Maintainability and Extensibility

The modular design with clear interfaces makes the system easier to maintain and extend with new features or integrations.

## System Overview

The loan management system is a web-based application with a multi-tiered architecture consisting of a React-based frontend, Django REST API backend, PostgreSQL database, and various supporting services.

## Key Architectural Patterns

The system implements several architectural patterns to ensure maintainability, scalability, and separation of concerns:

### Layered Architecture

Both frontend and backend follow a layered architecture:

**Frontend Layers**:
- Presentation Layer: React components and UI elements
- State Management Layer: Redux store, actions, and reducers
- Service Layer: API client and business logic
- Utility Layer: Helper functions and utilities

**Backend Layers**:
- Presentation Layer: API views and serializers
- Service Layer: Business logic in service classes
- Data Access Layer: Models and repositories
- Infrastructure Layer: Cross-cutting concerns

### Repository Pattern

Data access is abstracted through service classes that encapsulate database operations. This provides a clean separation between business logic and data access, making it easier to test and maintain the codebase.

### Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)

For complex domains like underwriting and document management, the system separates read operations (queries) from write operations (commands) to optimize for different requirements.

### Event-Driven Architecture

The system uses events to communicate between components, enabling loose coupling and asynchronous processing. Key events include application status changes, document generation, and signature completion.

### Microservices-Inspired Approach

While not a full microservices architecture, the system is organized into domain-specific services with clear boundaries and responsibilities. This approach provides many of the benefits of microservices while avoiding some of the operational complexity.

## Data Flow

The system's primary data flows illustrate how information moves through the various components during key business processes.

### Loan Application Flow

```
1. User submits loan application through frontend
2. Frontend validates form data and sends to API
3. API validates application data and creates application record
4. API triggers notification to borrower and school
5. Application enters underwriting queue
6. Underwriter reviews application and makes decision
7. Decision triggers document generation
8. Documents sent for e-signature
9. Signed documents trigger quality control review
10. Approved documents trigger funding process
11. Funding confirmation sent to school and borrower
```

### Document Processing Flow

```
1. Event triggers document generation (e.g., application approval)
2. Backend generates document from template with application data
3. Document stored in S3 with metadata in database
4. E-signature request created in DocuSign
5. Notification sent to signers
6. Signers complete signatures in DocuSign
7. DocuSign webhook notifies system of completion
8. System retrieves signed document and updates status
9. Notification sent to relevant parties
```

### Authentication Flow

```
1. User attempts to log in through frontend
2. Frontend redirects to Auth0 login page
3. User authenticates with Auth0
4. Auth0 redirects back to application with tokens
5. Frontend stores tokens and retrieves user profile
6. API requests include access token for authentication
7. Backend validates token and authorizes requests
8. Token refresh occurs automatically when needed
```

## Security Architecture

Security is a critical aspect of the loan management system, given the sensitive nature of the financial and personal data being processed.

### Authentication and Authorization

- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication via Auth0 with support for MFA

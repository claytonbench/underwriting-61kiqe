# Loan Management System API Documentation

## Introduction

This document provides comprehensive documentation for the Loan Management System API, which enables programmatic access to the system's functionality. The API follows RESTful design principles, uses JSON for data exchange, and implements OAuth 2.0 with JWT tokens for authentication and authorization.

### API Design Principles

The API is designed following these core principles:
- RESTful architecture with resource-oriented endpoints
- JSON as the primary data format
- Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) for CRUD operations
- Consistent URL patterns and naming conventions
- Comprehensive error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Versioning to ensure backward compatibility

### Base URL

All API endpoints are prefixed with `/api/v1/` to indicate the API version. This allows for future versions to be introduced without breaking existing integrations.

### API Architecture Overview

The Loan Management System API follows a layered architecture:
- Gateway Layer: API gateway for authentication, rate limiting, and routing
- Service Layer: Business logic implementation for API endpoints
- Data Access Layer: Database interactions and data validation
- Integration Layer: Connections to external services like Auth0, DocuSign, and SendGrid

This architecture ensures separation of concerns, scalability, and maintainability of the API codebase.

## Authentication and Authorization

The Loan Management System API uses Auth0 as the identity provider and implements OAuth 2.0/OIDC for authentication. JWT tokens are used for maintaining session state and authorizing API requests.

### Authentication Methods

The API supports the following authentication methods:
- OAuth 2.0/OIDC with Auth0 for user authentication
- API keys for service-to-service communication
- JWT tokens for session management
- Client certificates for high-security integrations with financial partners

### Token Management

JWT tokens have the following characteristics:
- Access tokens expire after 1 hour
- Refresh tokens can be used to obtain new access tokens
- Tokens contain user identity and role information
- Tokens must be included in the Authorization header as Bearer tokens

### Authorization Framework

The API implements a comprehensive authorization framework:
- Role-based access control (RBAC) with predefined roles
- Resource ownership rules (users can only access their own data)
- Context-based authorization (application state influences available actions)
- Permission checks at multiple levels (API gateway, service layer, data access)

### Authentication Endpoints

The following endpoints are available for authentication:
- POST /api/v1/auth/login/ - Authenticate user and get tokens
- POST /api/v1/auth/token/refresh/ - Refresh an access token

## Request and Response Formats

All API requests and responses use JSON as the primary data format. The API follows consistent patterns for request parameters, response structures, and error handling.

### Common Request Headers

The following headers are commonly used in API requests:
- `Authorization`: Bearer token for authentication
- `Content-Type`: application/json for request body
- `Accept`: application/json for response format
- `X-Request-ID`: Optional client-generated request identifier for tracing

### Response Structure

API responses follow a consistent structure:
- Success responses include the requested data or confirmation message
- List endpoints include pagination metadata (count, next, previous, results)
- Error responses include error code, message, and details
- All timestamps use ISO 8601 format in UTC timezone

### Pagination

List endpoints support pagination with the following parameters:
- `page`: Page number (default: 1)
- `page_size`: Number of items per page (default: 25, max: 100)

Paginated responses include the following metadata:
```json
{
  "count": 100,
  "next": "https://api.example.com/api/v1/resource/?page=3",
  "previous": "https://api.example.com/api/v1/resource/?page=1",
  "results": []
}
```

### Filtering and Sorting

List endpoints support filtering and sorting with the following parameters:
- Filter by field: `?field_name=value`
- Filter by multiple values: `?field_name__in=value1,value2`
- Filter by range: `?field_name__gte=min&field_name__lte=max`
- Sort by field: `?ordering=field_name` (ascending) or `?ordering=-field_name` (descending)
- Sort by multiple fields: `?ordering=field1,-field2`

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes and provides detailed error information in the response body.

### HTTP Status Codes

The API uses the following HTTP status codes:
- 200 OK: Successful request
- 201 Created: Resource created successfully
- 204 No Content: Successful request with no response body
- 400 Bad Request: Invalid request parameters
- 401 Unauthorized: Authentication required or failed
- 403 Forbidden: Permission denied
- 404 Not Found: Resource not found
- 409 Conflict: Resource conflict (e.g., duplicate entry)
- 422 Unprocessable Entity: Validation error
- 429 Too Many Requests: Rate limit exceeded
- 500 Internal Server Error: Server error

### Error Response Format

Error responses follow this format:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "error_code",
    "message": "Human-readable error message",
    "details": {
      "field_name": ["Error detail for specific field"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Validation Errors

Validation errors (422 Unprocessable Entity) include field-specific error messages:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "validation_error",
    "message": "Validation failed",
    "details": {
      "email": ["Enter a valid email address."],
      "password": ["Password must be at least 12 characters long."]
    }
  }
}
```

### Error Codes

The API uses the following error codes:
- `authentication_failed`: Authentication failed
- `permission_denied`: Permission denied
- `resource_not_found`: Resource not found
- `validation_error`: Validation error
- `rate_limit_exceeded`: Rate limit exceeded
- `server_error`: Server error
- `business_rule_violation`: Business rule violation
- `duplicate_entry`: Duplicate entry

## Rate Limiting

The API implements rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.

### Rate Limit Headers

Rate limit information is included in response headers:
- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum requests allowed in the time window
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Requests remaining in the current window
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Time when the rate limit resets (Unix timestamp)

### Rate Limit Tiers

Different rate limits apply based on the client type:
- Unauthenticated requests: 10 requests per minute
- Authenticated users: 60 requests per minute
- Internal services: 1000 requests per minute
- Batch operations: 5 requests per minute (queue-based throttling)

### Rate Limit Exceeded

When a rate limit is exceeded, the API returns a 429 Too Many Requests response with a Retry-After header indicating when to retry.

## Versioning

The API uses URI path versioning to ensure backward compatibility as the API evolves.

### Version Format

API versions are specified in the URI path: `/api/v1/resource/`

### Compatibility Policy

The API follows these versioning principles:
- Breaking changes trigger a new major version
- Non-breaking additions can be made to existing versions
- Deprecated endpoints remain available for at least 6 months
- Deprecation notices are provided in response headers

### Deprecation Headers

Deprecated endpoints include the following headers:
- `Deprecation: true`
- `Sunset: Sat, 31 Dec 2023 23:59:59 GMT`
- `Link: <https://api.example.com/api/v2/resource/>; rel="successor-version"`

## API Documentation

- Event data
- Signature for verification

### Webhook Security

Webhooks are secured using:
- HMAC signatures for payload verification
- TLS for transport security
- Configurable IP allowlisting
- Retry mechanism for failed deliveries

## Integration Patterns

The API supports various integration patterns for different use cases.

### Synchronous Request/Response

Used for immediate operations like data validation and retrieval:
- Client makes HTTP request
- Server processes request and returns response
- Client handles response or error

### Asynchronous Processing

Used for long-running operations like document generation:
- Client initiates operation and receives a task ID
- Server processes the task asynchronously
- Client polls for task status or receives webhook notification

### Batch Processing

Used for bulk operations like importing multiple records:
- Client submits batch job with multiple items
- Server processes items in background
- Client receives batch job ID and can check status
- Results available when processing completes

### Event-Driven

Used for reactive integrations:
- Client subscribes to webhook events
- Server sends event notifications when events occur
- Client processes events asynchronously

## Security Considerations

The API implements multiple security measures to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access.

### Transport Security

All API communications use TLS 1.2+ to encrypt data in transit. HTTP requests are automatically redirected to HTTPS.

### Authentication Security

Authentication security measures include:
- Short-lived access tokens (1 hour)
- Secure token storage recommendations
- Multi-factor authentication support
- Account lockout after failed attempts

### Authorization Controls

Authorization controls include:
- Fine-grained permissions based on roles
- Resource ownership verification
- Context-aware authorization rules
- Audit logging of access attempts

### Data Protection

Data protection measures include:
- Sensitive data filtering from responses
- Field-level encryption for PII
- Data minimization in API responses
- Secure handling of financial information

## API Client Recommendations

Recommendations for implementing API clients to ensure reliable and secure integration.

### Authentication Best Practices

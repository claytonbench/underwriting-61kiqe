## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for the Loan Management System. The CI/CD pipeline automates the building, testing, and deployment of the application across different environments, ensuring consistent and reliable delivery of new features and bug fixes.

## CI/CD Architecture Overview

The CI/CD pipeline is built using GitHub Actions and AWS services, providing a fully automated workflow from code commit to production deployment. The pipeline follows a multi-environment promotion strategy with appropriate testing and validation at each stage.

### Pipeline Components

The CI/CD pipeline consists of the following key components:

- **Source Control**: GitHub repository for code management
- **CI System**: GitHub Actions for automated builds and tests
- **Container Registry**: Amazon ECR for storing Docker images
- **Deployment Platform**: AWS ECS for container orchestration
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform for infrastructure provisioning
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch and New Relic for deployment monitoring

### Environment Strategy

The system uses a multi-environment strategy with the following environments:

- **Development**: Continuous deployment from the `develop` branch
- **Staging**: Controlled deployment from the `staging` branch with blue/green deployment
- **Production**: Highly controlled deployment from release tags with blue/green deployment and canary testing

Each environment has its own isolated infrastructure and configuration, with progressively stricter controls as code moves toward production.

## Continuous Integration

The Continuous Integration (CI) process automatically builds and tests code changes to ensure quality and prevent integration issues.

### Backend CI Workflow

The backend CI workflow is triggered on pull requests and pushes to the main branches (`main` and `develop`) that affect backend code. The workflow performs the following steps:

1. **Code Checkout**: Retrieves the latest code from the repository
2. **Environment Setup**: Sets up Python 3.11 with dependencies
3. **Code Quality Checks**:
   - Linting with flake8
   - Type checking with mypy
   - Security scanning with bandit and safety
4. **Unit Tests**: Runs pytest with coverage reporting
5. **Docker Build**: Builds the backend Docker image
6. **Security Scanning**: Scans the Docker image for vulnerabilities using Trivy

The workflow configuration is defined in `.github/workflows/backend-ci.yml`.

### Frontend CI Workflow

The frontend CI workflow is triggered on pull requests and pushes to the main branches (`main` and `develop`) that affect frontend code. The workflow performs the following steps:

1. **Code Checkout**: Retrieves the latest code from the repository
2. **Environment Setup**: Sets up Node.js 18 with dependencies
3. **Code Quality Checks**:
   - Linting with ESLint
   - Type checking with TypeScript
4. **Unit Tests**: Runs Jest tests with coverage reporting
5. **Build**: Builds the frontend application
6. **Security Scanning**: Scans dependencies for vulnerabilities
7. **Docker Build**: Builds the frontend Docker image
8. **Security Scanning**: Scans the Docker image for vulnerabilities using Trivy

The workflow configuration is defined in `.github/workflows/frontend-ci.yml`.

### Quality Gates

The CI pipeline includes the following quality gates that must be passed before code can be merged:

- **Unit Tests**: All tests must pass with no failures
- **Code Coverage**: Minimum 80% code coverage for backend, 70% for frontend
- **Linting**: No linting errors allowed
- **Security Scanning**: No critical or high vulnerabilities allowed
- **Type Checking**: No type errors allowed

These quality gates are enforced through branch protection rules in GitHub, preventing merges of code that doesn't meet the quality standards.

### CI Best Practices

When working with the CI system, follow these best practices:

1. **Run Tests Locally**: Before pushing code, run tests locally to catch issues early
   - Backend: Run `pytest` to execute unit tests
   - Frontend: Run `jest` to execute component and unit tests
   - Use `coverage` reports to ensure sufficient test coverage
   - Run linting tools locally: `flake8` for backend, `eslint` for frontend

2. **Keep PRs Small**: Smaller PRs are easier to review and test
3. **Fix CI Issues Promptly**: Address CI failures as soon as they occur
4. **Monitor Build Times**: Keep an eye on build times and optimize when necessary
5. **Update Dependencies Regularly**: Regularly update dependencies to avoid security issues
6. **Test Coverage**: Ensure new code has adequate test coverage focusing on:
   - Edge cases and error conditions
   - Business logic validation
   - Integration points between components
   - Security-sensitive functionality

## Continuous Deployment

The Continuous Deployment (CD) process automatically deploys code changes to different environments after passing the CI process.

### Development Environment Deployment

The development environment deployment is triggered automatically when code is merged to the `develop` branch. The workflow performs the following steps:

1. **Code Checkout**: Retrieves the latest code from the repository
2. **Environment Setup**: Sets up required tools and credentials
3. **Build and Push**: Builds and pushes Docker images to ECR
4. **Deploy**: Updates ECS services with the new images
5. **Verification**: Performs basic health checks to verify deployment

The development deployment uses a simple rolling update strategy with minimal downtime. The workflow configuration is defined in `.github/workflows/deploy-dev.yml`.

### Staging Environment Deployment

The staging environment deployment is triggered automatically when code is merged to the `staging` branch. The workflow performs the following steps:

1. **Code Checkout**: Retrieves the latest code from the repository
2. **Environment Setup**: Sets up required tools and credentials
3. **Build and Push**: Builds and pushes Docker images to ECR
4. **Blue/Green Deployment**: Creates a new deployment with CodeDeploy
5. **Integration Tests**: Runs integration tests against the new deployment
6. **Verification**: Verifies the deployment is functioning correctly
7. **Completion**: Completes the deployment if all tests pass

The staging deployment uses a blue/green deployment strategy with a 10% initial traffic shift, followed by full traffic shift after validation. The workflow configuration is defined in `.github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml`.

### Production Environment Deployment

The production environment deployment is triggered when a release tag (e.g., `v1.2.3`) is pushed to the repository or manually triggered with approval. The workflow performs the following steps:

1. **Approval**: Requires manual approval from authorized personnel
2. **Code Checkout**: Retrieves the latest code from the repository
3. **Environment Setup**: Sets up required tools and credentials
4. **Build and Push**: Builds and pushes Docker images to ECR
5. **Blue/Green Deployment**: Creates a new deployment with CodeDeploy
6. **Canary Deployment**: Initially routes 10% of traffic to the new version
7. **Integration Tests**: Runs comprehensive integration tests
8. **Canary Expansion**: Increases traffic to 50% if tests pass
9. **Monitoring**: Monitors error rates and performance metrics
10. **Full Deployment**: Completes the deployment with 100% traffic if all checks pass

The production deployment uses a blue/green deployment strategy with canary testing to minimize risk. The workflow configuration is defined in `.github/workflows/deploy-prod.yml`.

### Deployment Scripts

In addition to GitHub Actions workflows, the system includes shell scripts for manual deployment and troubleshooting:

- **deploy.sh**: Script for deploying to any environment with various options
- **rollback.sh**: Script for rolling back deployments in case of issues

These scripts are located in the `infrastructure/scripts` directory and can be used for manual deployments or when GitHub Actions is not available.

## Environment Configuration Management

The system uses a structured approach to manage configuration across different environments.

### Configuration Sources

Configuration is managed through the following sources:

1. **Environment Variables**: Runtime configuration stored in AWS Parameter Store
2. **Secrets**: Sensitive configuration stored in AWS Secrets Manager
3. **Infrastructure Configuration**: Environment-specific Terraform variables
4. **Application Configuration**: Environment-specific settings in code

This approach ensures that configuration is properly separated and secured across environments.

### Configuration Promotion

Configuration changes follow a promotion path similar to code changes:

1. **Development**: Configuration changes are tested in development first
2. **Staging**: After validation, configuration is promoted to staging
3. **Production**: Finally, configuration is promoted to production

Configuration promotion is managed through Terraform and AWS Parameter Store/Secrets Manager, with appropriate access controls at each level.

### Secret Management

Secrets are managed securely using the following practices:

1. **No Secrets in Code**: Secrets are never stored in the codebase
2. **Environment Isolation**: Each environment has its own set of secrets
3. **Least Privilege**: Access to secrets is restricted based on need
4. **Rotation**: Secrets are rotated regularly
5. **Audit Logging**: All secret access is logged and monitored

Secrets are stored in AWS Secrets Manager and accessed at runtime by the application.

## Rollback Procedures

Despite thorough testing, deployments may sometimes need to be rolled back. The system includes comprehensive rollback procedures for each environment.

### Automated Rollback

The deployment workflows include automated rollback capabilities:

1. **Staging Rollback**: If integration tests fail in staging, the deployment is automatically rolled back
2. **Production Canary Rollback**: If issues are detected during canary deployment, traffic is automatically shifted back to the previous version
3. **Production Full Rollback**: If issues are detected after full deployment, a rollback job is triggered

Automated rollbacks are implemented using AWS CodeDeploy's rollback features and custom scripts.

### Manual Rollback

For situations where automated rollback is not triggered or fails, manual rollback procedures are available:

1. **Using GitHub Actions**: Manually trigger the rollback workflow from GitHub
2. **Using Rollback Script**: Run the `rollback.sh` script with appropriate parameters
3. **Direct AWS Console**: Use the AWS Console to revert to previous task definitions

The `rollback.sh` script supports different rollback types:
- **Service Rollback**: Reverts ECS services to previous task definitions
- **Database Rollback**: Restores database from backup if needed
- **Full Rollback**: Performs both service and database rollback

Example usage:
```bash
./infrastructure/scripts/rollback.sh -e production -t service -s backend,frontend
```

### Rollback Testing

To ensure rollback procedures work when needed, regular rollback testing is performed:

1. **Scheduled Drills**: Monthly rollback drills in staging environment
2. **Post-Deployment Testing**: Rollback testing after major deployments
3. **Disaster Recovery Exercises**: Quarterly exercises including rollback scenarios

These tests help ensure that rollback procedures are effective and that the team is familiar with the process.

## Monitoring and Alerting

Comprehensive monitoring and alerting are essential for effective CI/CD operations.

### Deployment Monitoring

Deployments are monitored through the following mechanisms:

1. **GitHub Actions Logs**: Real-time logs of deployment workflows
2. **AWS CloudWatch**: Metrics and logs for AWS services
3. **New Relic APM**: Application performance monitoring
4. **Custom Dashboards**: Deployment-specific dashboards showing key metrics

These tools provide visibility into the deployment process and help identify issues quickly.

### Deployment Alerts

The system includes alerts for deployment events:

1. **Deployment Start**: Notification when a deployment begins
2. **Deployment Success**: Notification when a deployment completes successfully
3. **Deployment Failure**: Immediate alert when a deployment fails
4. **Rollback Triggered**: Alert when a rollback is initiated

Alerts are sent via Slack and email to the appropriate teams based on the environment and severity.

### Post-Deployment Monitoring

After a deployment, the system monitors for potential issues:

1. **Error Rate Monitoring**: Alerts if error rates increase above threshold
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Alerts if response times degrade
3. **Business Metrics**: Monitors key business metrics for anomalies
4. **Synthetic Transactions**: Regularly tests critical user flows

This monitoring helps detect issues that may not be caught during the deployment process itself.

## CI/CD Security

Security is integrated throughout the CI/CD pipeline to ensure the integrity and security of the deployment process.

### Pipeline Security

The CI/CD pipeline includes the following security measures:

1. **Secrets Management**: Secrets are stored securely in GitHub Secrets and AWS Secrets Manager
2. **Least Privilege**: CI/CD systems use minimal permissions needed for deployment
3. **Approval Gates**: Production deployments require explicit approval
4. **Audit Logging**: All pipeline actions are logged for audit purposes

These measures help prevent unauthorized access to the deployment pipeline.

### Security Scanning

Security scanning is integrated into the CI/CD pipeline:

1. **Dependency Scanning**: Checks for vulnerabilities in dependencies
2. **SAST**: Static Application Security Testing for code vulnerabilities
3. **Container Scanning**: Scans Docker images for vulnerabilities
4. **Infrastructure Scanning**: Checks Terraform code for security issues

Security issues found during scanning must be addressed before deployment can proceed.

### Compliance Validation

The CI/CD pipeline includes compliance validation steps:

1. **Policy Checks**: Ensures deployments comply with organizational policies
2. **Regulatory Checks**: Validates compliance with relevant regulations
3. **Documentation**: Automatically generates compliance documentation

These checks help ensure that all deployments meet the required compliance standards.

## CI/CD Pipeline Maintenance

The CI/CD pipeline itself requires regular maintenance to ensure it continues to function effectively.

### Pipeline Updates

The CI/CD pipeline is updated through the following process:

1. **Workflow Changes**: Updates to GitHub Actions workflows
2. **Script Updates**: Updates to deployment and rollback scripts
3. **Infrastructure Updates**: Updates to the underlying infrastructure

All changes to the CI/CD pipeline follow the same review and testing process as application code.

### Performance Optimization

The CI/CD pipeline is regularly optimized for performance:

1. **Build Time Optimization**: Reducing the time taken for builds
2. **Caching Strategies**: Effective use of caching to speed up builds
3. **Parallel Execution**: Running tests and builds in parallel
4. **Resource Allocation**: Ensuring appropriate resources for CI/CD jobs

These optimizations help reduce the time from code commit to deployment.

### Pipeline Metrics

The following metrics are tracked to evaluate CI/CD performance:

1. **Build Success Rate**: Percentage of successful builds
2. **Build Time**: Time taken for builds to complete
3. **Deployment Frequency**: How often deployments occur
4. **Lead Time**: Time from commit to deployment
5. **Mean Time to Recovery**: Time to recover from failures

These metrics help identify areas for improvement in the CI/CD process.

## Developer Workflow

This section describes how developers interact with the CI/CD pipeline in their daily work.

### Code Submission Process

Developers follow this process when submitting code:

1. **Create Feature Branch**: Branch from `develop` for new features
2. **Local Testing**: Run tests locally before pushing
3. **Push Changes**: Push changes to GitHub
4. **Create Pull Request**: Create PR targeting `develop`
5. **CI Validation**: Wait for CI checks to pass
6. **Code Review**: Address review comments
7. **Merge**: Merge code after approval

This process ensures that all code is properly tested and reviewed before deployment.

### Monitoring Deployments

Developers can monitor their deployments through:

1. **GitHub Actions UI**: View workflow runs and logs
2. **Slack Notifications**: Receive deployment status updates
3. **Deployment Dashboards**: Monitor application metrics after deployment

Developers are responsible for monitoring the impact of their changes after deployment.

### Handling Deployment Issues

When deployment issues occur, developers should follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Issue**: Use logs and monitoring to identify the problem
2. **Assess Impact**: Determine the severity and scope of the issue
3. **Fix or Rollback**: Either fix the issue quickly or initiate a rollback
4. **Post-Mortem**: Document the issue and prevention measures

The team lead or on-call engineer may assist with deployment issues, especially in production.

## Release Management

The release management process coordinates the planning, scheduling, and control of software releases.

### Release Versioning

The system uses semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) for releases:

- **MAJOR**: Incompatible API changes
- **MINOR**: New features in a backward-compatible manner
- **PATCH**: Backward-compatible bug fixes

Release tags follow the format `v1.2.3` and are used to trigger production deployments.

### Release Planning

Releases are planned through the following process:

1. **Feature Selection**: Determine features for the next release
2. **Release Schedule**: Set target dates for staging and production
3. **Testing Plan**: Define testing requirements for the release
4. **Documentation**: Update documentation for new features

Release planning is coordinated by the product manager and development team lead.

### Release Notes

Release notes are generated for each production release:

1. **Feature Summary**: Overview of new features
2. **Bug Fixes**: List of fixed issues
3. **Known Issues**: Any known issues or limitations
4. **Upgrade Notes**: Instructions for upgrading if needed

Release notes are published in GitHub Releases and shared with stakeholders.

### Hotfix Process

For urgent fixes that can't wait for the regular release cycle:

1. **Create Hotfix Branch**: Branch from `main` or the latest release tag
2. **Implement Fix**: Make minimal changes to address the issue
3. **Test**: Thoroughly test the fix
4. **Deploy**: Deploy to production after approval
5. **Merge Back**: Merge the fix back to `develop`

Hotfixes follow the same quality and approval requirements as regular releases but with expedited processing.

## Disaster Recovery

In addition to standard rollback procedures, the system includes comprehensive disaster recovery capabilities for more severe incidents.

### Disaster Scenarios

The disaster recovery plan addresses the following scenarios:

1. **Infrastructure Failure**: AWS region or service outage
2. **Data Corruption**: Database or file corruption
3. **Security Breach**: Unauthorized access or data breach
4. **Deployment Failure**: Failed deployment that cannot be rolled back normally

Each scenario has specific recovery procedures documented in the disaster recovery plan.

### Recovery Procedures

The general recovery procedure follows these steps:

1. **Incident Declaration**: Declare a disaster recovery incident
2. **Team Assembly**: Assemble the disaster recovery team
3. **Assessment**: Assess the extent of the incident
4. **Recovery Plan**: Select and execute the appropriate recovery plan
5. **Verification**: Verify the recovery was successful
6. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify and address the root cause

Detailed procedures for each scenario are documented in the disaster recovery plan.

### Recovery Testing

To ensure recovery procedures work when needed, regular testing is performed:

1. **Tabletop Exercises**: Quarterly discussion-based exercises
2. **Functional Testing**: Semi-annual testing of recovery procedures
3. **Full DR Test**: Annual full disaster recovery test

These tests help ensure that recovery procedures are effective and that the team is prepared for incidents.

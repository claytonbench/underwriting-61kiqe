# Loan Management System Documentation

## Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for the Educational Loan Management System. This comprehensive platform enables schools, students (borrowers), co-borrowers, and internal staff to manage the entire educational loan lifecycle from application through funding.

The system streamlines what was previously an inefficient, manual process by providing:

- **Centralized loan application processing** for educational financing
- **Role-based interfaces** for all stakeholders (schools, borrowers, underwriters, QC)
- **End-to-end workflow management** from application to funding
- **Automated document generation and e-signature collection**
- **Secure handling** of sensitive personal and financial information

## Documentation Structure

This documentation is organized into the following main sections to help different audiences find relevant information:

### Architecture Documentation

Technical documentation of the system design and architecture:

- [Backend Architecture](architecture/backend.md) - Service components, API design, data flow
- [Frontend Architecture](architecture/frontend.md) - UI framework, component structure, state management
- [Data Model](architecture/data-model.md) - Database schema, entity relationships, data flow
- [API Documentation](architecture/api.md) - API endpoints, request/response formats, authentication
- [Infrastructure Design](architecture/infrastructure.md) - Cloud resources, deployment architecture, networking

### Development Guide

Resources for developers working on the system:

- [Development Environment Setup](development/setup.md) - Instructions for setting up local development
- [Coding Standards](development/coding-standards.md) - Style guides and best practices
- [Testing Guidelines](development/testing.md) - Unit, integration, and end-to-end testing approaches
- [CI/CD Workflows](development/ci-cd.md) - Build and deployment pipeline documentation

### Operations Guide

Information for deploying, monitoring, and maintaining the system:

- [Deployment Procedures](operations/deployment.md) - Step-by-step deployment instructions
- [Monitoring and Alerting](operations/monitoring.md) - System health monitoring, metrics, dashboards
- [Backup and Recovery](operations/backup-recovery.md) - Backup procedures and disaster recovery
- [Security Operations](operations/security.md) - Security controls, compliance, audit procedures

### User Guides

Role-specific documentation for system users:

## Getting Started

**New to the documentation?** Here's how to find what you need:

1. **For business stakeholders**: Start with the [System Overview](architecture/overview.md) to understand the system's capabilities and workflow.

2. **For developers**: Begin with the [Development Environment Setup](development/setup.md) guide followed by the [Architecture Documentation](#architecture-documentation).

3. **For operations teams**: Review the [Deployment Procedures](operations/deployment.md) and [Monitoring and Alerting](operations/monitoring.md) documentation.

4. **For end users**: Go directly to the appropriate [User Guide](#user-guides) for your role.

## Contributing to Documentation

We maintain documentation alongside code to ensure it stays current and accurate. To contribute:

1. Follow the same branching and pull request workflow as code changes
2. Use clear, concise language and provide examples where appropriate
3. Maintain the established formatting for consistency
4. Update diagrams when architectural changes occur
5. Test any code examples or procedures before submitting

For substantial changes to documentation, please discuss your proposed changes with the team before investing significant time.

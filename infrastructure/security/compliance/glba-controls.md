# GLBA Compliance Controls

## Introduction

This document outlines how the loan management system implements controls to comply with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA). As a financial system processing educational loans, the system is subject to GLBA requirements for protecting nonpublic personal information (NPI) of consumers, including financial and personal data collected during the loan application and management process.

## Scope

The scope of GLBA compliance covers all components of the loan management system that process, store, or transmit nonpublic personal information, including the application servers, databases, network infrastructure, and third-party integrations. The system implements the three principal parts of GLBA: the Financial Privacy Rule, the Safeguards Rule, and the Pretexting Protection.

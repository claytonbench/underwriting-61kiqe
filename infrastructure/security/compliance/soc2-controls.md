# SOC 2 Compliance Controls

## Introduction
This document outlines how the loan management system implements controls to comply with SOC 2 (Service Organization Control 2) requirements. SOC 2 is an auditing standard developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) that focuses on a service organization's non-financial reporting controls as they relate to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy of a system.

## Scope
The scope of SOC 2 compliance covers all components of the loan management system that process, store, or transmit customer data, including the application servers, databases, network infrastructure, and third-party integrations. The system implements controls across all five trust service criteria: Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy.

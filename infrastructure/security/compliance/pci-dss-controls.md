# PCI DSS Compliance Controls

## Introduction
This document outlines how the loan management system implements controls to comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). While the system primarily processes educational loans, it may handle payment card information during certain transactions such as application fees or loan payments, requiring adherence to PCI DSS standards for cardholder data protection.

## Scope
The scope of PCI DSS compliance covers all components of the loan management system that process, store, or transmit cardholder data, including the application servers, databases, network infrastructure, and third-party payment integrations. The system implements a cardholder data environment (CDE) with appropriate segmentation and controls.
